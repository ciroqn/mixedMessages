SMALL PROJECT TO TEST USER INTERFACE

## Introduction
This is a small project incorporating some JavaScript (based on one of CodeCademy's projects for creating random messages). I decided to create a webpage around this and create a bit of a theme (namely a random dialogue between two 'busts', namely Socrates and a cantakerous student). 

## Technologies
* Bootstrap 4
* HTML5
